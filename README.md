MethylMapR Package
By: Chris Morrissey and Arun Sethuraman

MethylMapR is an R pipeline for creating functional methylomes from PacBio single molecule real time sequencing data.

MethylMapR expects the PacBio output from kineticstools, specifically the motifs.gff and modifications.csv files.
All other datatypes -- coding sequence, transcriptional data, and transcription factor binding data can be of numerous output types.
